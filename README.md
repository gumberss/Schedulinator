# Schedulinator

The core objective of this project is to develop a proof of concept for a high-performance scheduler capable of efficiently processing millions of tasks per second, leveraging the power of Redis Sorted Sets. This initiative seeks to identify the next tasks directly through Redis, thus eliminating the need for expensive database reads. Before use this project, it's crucial to conduct a thorough analysis to determine if it aligns with your specific needs. For instance, if your execution rate is relatively low, opting for Redis may not be the most cost-effective choice. Redis incurs costs based on the number of nodes (when using AWS at least), so in such cases, using a database like DynamoDb directly could be a more economical alternative.
